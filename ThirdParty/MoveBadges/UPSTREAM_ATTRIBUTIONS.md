# Attributions & Licenses

This extension is an independent, unofficial tool. It is **not affiliated with,
endorsed by, or sponsored by Chess.com or Lichess**. Third-party components
retain their respective licenses. The records below identify known
sources and licensing terms; entries marked unresolved are not claims of
redistribution permission.

## Community contributions
- **[neuroflowinfinix](https://github.com/neuroflowinfinix)** — proposed and implemented
  coach/commentary layering and explicit move-category labels in
  [PR #10](https://github.com/T-Julsgaard/Chess-Review/pull/10). These UI changes
  were adapted here; category labels appear only when special coach replies are enabled.
- Also recommended removing the obsolete asm.js fallback in that PR. The maintainer
  implemented the engine cleanup separately; credit is retained for the recommendation.

## Chess pieces (bundled SVG sets)
Distributed by Lichess (lila); high-quality vector SVGs.
- **Cburnett** (`pieces-img/cburnett/*.svg`) — Author: Colin M.L. Burnett. License: **GPLv2+**.
- **Merida** (`pieces-img/merida/*.svg`) — Author: Armando Hernandez Marroquin. License: **GPLv2+**.
- **Source:** https://github.com/lichess-org/lila/tree/master/public/piece
- **Licensing reference:** https://github.com/lichess-org/lila/blob/master/COPYING.md
- Note: GPLv2+ permits redistribution (incl. commercial) provided the licence/source terms
  are met. Noncommercial piece sets are excluded from the current build allowlist.

## Removed artwork — historical provenance record
- On the maintainer's instruction, Kaneo, Kaneo Midnight, 1Kbyte Gambit, and the
  five Kadagaden board SVGs were removed from the current checkout on 2026-09-30.
  They are absent from new browser/source ZIPs and from the current settings UI.
- **Former source:** Kadagaden, https://github.com/Kadagaden/chess-pieces;
  received with upstream's CC BY 4.0 attribution. Underlying artwork permissions
  were not independently established. This record does not retroactively clear them.
- Existing release archives and Git history are preserved. Historical copies may
  still contain these assets; current removal does not alter earlier distribution.
- Remaining bundled pieces are Cburnett and Merida, as credited above.
- Maestro and Maestro B/W are not included. The maintainer has chosen not to add
  those noncommercial sets. Licensing reference:
  https://github.com/lichess-org/lila/blob/master/COPYING.md

## Board colors
- Boards use selectable flat-color palettes or custom colors. Honeywood is the default.
- Platform-theme detection, palette matching, and the compatibility palettes were
  removed on 2026-09-30. Historical archives and Git history may retain them.

## Country flags
- **Files:** `flags/*.svg` (used as player avatars when a country is detected)
- **Pack:** **Flag Pack (1.0)** by **Kenney** (www.kenney.nl) — https://www.kenney.nl/assets/flag-pack
- **License:** **CC0 1.0** (public domain) — https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/
- Free for personal, educational, and commercial use. Attribution is **not required**; we credit
  **Kenney / www.kenney.nl** here voluntarily, as the pack's license suggests.
- The Chess.com country id → flag mapping in `flags.js` was compiled by hand (`flag_map.csv`) and
  is original to this project.

## Move / board sounds
- **Files:** `sounds/move-self.mp3`, `sounds/capture.mp3`, `sounds/Check.mp3`,
  `sounds/Castling.mp3`
- **Source:** Lichess sound set (lila) —
  https://github.com/lichess-org/lila/blob/master/LICENSE
- **License:** commercial sound license purchased by the maintainer.
- **Underlying sample credit:** the samples embed the tag
  "Copyright 2000, Sounddogs.com" (commercial royalty-free library, as redistributed
  by Lichess). Retained here for transparency.

- **Source:** `lichess-org/chess-openings`
- **License:** CC0 (public domain) — https://github.com/lichess-org/chess-openings

## Chess logic library
- **File:** `lib/chess.js`
- **Author:** Jeff Hlywa — **License:** BSD 2-Clause
- **Upstream version:** chess.js **1.0.0**, `dist/esm/chess.js` from the official npm package.
- **Original distribution:** https://registry.npmjs.org/chess.js/-/chess.js-1.0.0.tgz
- **Readable source:** https://github.com/jhlywa/chess.js/blob/v1.0.0/src/chess.ts
- **Release/build instructions:** https://github.com/jhlywa/chess.js/tree/v1.0.0
- **Verification:** The initial bundled file matches the official 1.0.0 distribution
  after normalizing line endings; the current file differs only by the local changes below.
- **Local maintenance:** Replace every PGN comment brace and remove a no-op newline
  masking helper while preserving regular-expression separators. The original license notice is retained.

## Adapted move classifier
- **File:** `analysis.js` (move classification, including attacker/defender and
  sacrifice logic; locally adapted evaluation handling and classification rules).
- **Project:** Brilliant-Chess by **Delo** (`wdeloo`).
- **Copyright:** Copyright (c) 2025 Delo <https://github.com/wdeloo>
- **License:** MIT. The complete copyright and permission notice is included in
  [THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md](THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md) and shipped with the extension.
- **Source:** https://github.com/wdeloo/Brilliant-Chess
- **License reference:** https://github.com/wdeloo/Brilliant-Chess/blob/56e8c48696d3df874f4f1e0f26cb47bedff3231c/LICENSE
- This reference identifies the verified license text; it does not claim that the
  original adaptation was made from that exact upstream commit.

## Move-category badges
- **Author:** T-Julsgaard, project maintainer.
- **Files:** `icons/brilliant.svg`, `icons/great.svg`, `icons/book.svg`,
  `icons/best.svg`, `icons/excellent.svg`, `icons/good.svg`, `icons/inaccuracy.svg`,
  `icons/mistake.svg`, `icons/miss.svg`, and `icons/blunder.svg`.
- **Source:** maintainer-created badge artwork. The maintainer confirmed authorship
  on 2026-09-30; this records that declaration, not independent verification of
  every creation input. The redesigned symbols retain the previous circle colours.
- **License:** GNU GPL v3.0, under the project's [LICENSE](LICENSE).
- **Design record:** `design/icon-explorations/README.md`, `selection.json`, and
  preserved design iterations identify the selected drawings. Original snapshots
  are historical references, not the active badge set.

## App logo / icon
- **Files:** `icons/icon16.png`, `icons/icon48.png`, `icons/icon128.png`, `icons/icon.png`
- Project logo composition incorporating Colin M.L. Burnett's ("Cburnett") white
  knight design. Copyright in the underlying knight remains with its author.
- **Underlying artwork / licensing reference:** "Chess nlt45.svg" by Colin M.L.
  Burnett: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Chess_nlt45.svg
- **Selected license for the logo adaptation:** **CC BY-SA 3.0 Unported** —
  https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/
- **Changes:** the knight is incorporated into the project icon composition and
  distributed as raster PNGs at the sizes above. The logo adaptation is available
  under the same CC BY-SA 3.0 license. No endorsement by the original artist is implied.
- The Commons artwork offers multiple licenses; this records the CC BY-SA basis
  separately from the GPLv2+ licensing of the bundled board-piece set.
- **Creation record:** on 2026-09-30 the maintainer recalled using AI with the
  Cburnett piece to create the logo. This records that recollection; the exact AI
  tool, prompt, and original input file have not been established. AI processing
  does not remove the underlying artist's attribution or share-alike conditions.
- The stated Cburnett basis has a documented adaptation licence. Original creation
  files can be retained if recovered; this is not an independent verification of
  those inputs.

## Original project sounds, backgrounds, and coach artwork
- **Author:** T-Julsgaard, project maintainer.
- **Source:** original project work. Authorship was confirmed by the maintainer on
  2026-09-30; this entry records that declaration, not an independent forensic
  verification of the original creation files.
- **License:** GNU GPL v3.0, under the project's [LICENSE](LICENSE).
- **Files:**
- `sounds/fx/chess_sound_01.wav` through `sounds/fx/chess_sound_09.wav`.
- `backgrounds/bg-slate.webp` and `backgrounds/bg-ember.webp`.
- Animated coach artwork and rigs in `data/coaches-anim/rigs/*.html` and `*.js`.

These original assets are separate from the four Lichess move / board MP3 recordings
listed above. Retain original recordings/design files as supporting provenance.
